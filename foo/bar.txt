Couchapp will create a field on your document corresponding to any directories you make within the application directory, with the text of any files found as key/value pairs.

Also, any files that end in .json will be treated as json rather than text, and put in the corresponding field. Also note that file.json, file.js, or file.txt will be stored under the "file" key, so don't make collisions in the filesystem unless you want unpredictable results.

Of course you know that the views directory will be treated specially and -map and -reduce files will be mapped to the map and reduce functions. And the _attachments directory will be treated strangely as well.

doc.json is a special case, it is treated as json and its keys are applied to the document root; eg it does not result in a "doc" field on your design document. If you need a doc field on the design document, you'll have to define it with a doc.json like so: {"doc":"value for doc field"}

ps: each design document only has one language key: it will be set based on the file extensions in the views directory. CouchDB defaults to Javascript, so that's what you'll get if you don't define any views. You can override it with the doc.json file, but don't say we didn't warn you.

Oh yeah it's recommended that you delete this file.
